### Hi there 👋

I am Manuella Comerio (Manu for short), a sustainable development professional and (aspiring) urban data scientist.
I've completed my MSc in Urban Analytics at the University of Glasgow in 2024 with a full scholarship from the Chevening scheme, during which I developed my skills in R and Python programming. Afterwards, I also worked as a Research Assistant at the Urban Big Data Centre, University of Glasgow in the IDEAMAPS project, where I furthered honed my programming, analytical and research skills.


### Fields of interest 🧐

My research and professional interests lie at the intersection of resilient cities, climate justice, urban analytics and spatial data science. Specifically, I'm interested in how novel forms of data can help cities adapt and become resilient to the impacts of climate change.
