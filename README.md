### Hi there 👋

I am Manuella Comerio (Manu for short), a sustainable development professional and (aspiring) urban data scientist.
I've completed my MSc in Urban Analytics at the University of Glasgow in 2024 with a full scholarship from the Chevening scheme.
During my studies, I developed my skills in R and Python programming.
Currently I'm a Research Assistant at the Urban Big Data Centre, University of Glasgow working in the IDEAMAPS project.


### Fields of interest 🧐

My research and professional interests lie at the intersection of resilient cities, climate justice, urban analytics and spatial data science. Specifically, I'm interested in how novel forms of data can help cities adapt and become resilient to the impacts of climate change.
