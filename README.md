### Hi there 👋

I am Manuella Comerio (Manu for short), a sustainable development professional and (aspiring) urban data scientist.
Currently I'm a Chevening Scholar pursuing a master's degree in Urban Analytics at the University of Glasgow.


### Fields of interest 🧐

My research and professional interests lie at the intersection of resilient cities, climate justice, urban analytics and spatial data science. Specifically, I'm interested in how novel forms of data can help cities adapt and become resilient to the impacts of climate change.
